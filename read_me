This file describes the input, output and optimization technique for the MAX_CUT and Corelation Clustering problem.
The sourse file for the optimiations are
1. Max Cut problem : 				max_cut.py
2. Cortealtion Clustering Problem:	corelartion_clustering.py

For both the code system need python  and numpy and scipy.optimize ("SLSQP" optimization)  
______________________________________________________________
1.MAX CUT:

		Input : The number of the nodes in the graph is input to the graph . The command line 
				python max_cut.py n     # where n:= the number of nodes in the graph

				W: the weight matrix W is genrated randomly in [0,1]

		Output: As output the program prints the cut U,V and the cut value.
		
For the optimization purspose, we have used "SLSQP".

2. CORELATION CLUSTERING:
		
		Input :The number of the nodes in the graph is input to the graph . The command line 
				python corelation_clustering.py n     # where n:= the number of nodes in the graph

				W_p,W_n: the two weight matrix (corresponds to the inter and intra cluster edge weight) is genrated randomly in [0,1]

		Output: As output it prints the objective value and the 4 cluster it genrates R1,R2,R3,R4.


Notes:

The optimization is very slow. It does not scale with n (number of vertices).
